# Verilog and VHDL example projects
Examples of my VHDL and Verilog Projects from classes, and personal projects

Ram, ramprog, cpu and cputest combine to form a basic CPU with a few different programs (like multiplication) that can be "written" into memory by commenting and uncommenting sections of ramprog.v

I also made a basic cache system, a structural ALU, and several FSMs.

The final assignemnt of this class was a java program that could generate a netlist for a simple circuit, and then check it for race conditions.
