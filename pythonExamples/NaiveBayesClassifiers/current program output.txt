The most accurate modles are the Polynomial and Bernoulli predictors at 83.49 and 83.27 percent
accuracy on the test data. They are followed by the their smoothed versions and the TF-IDF classifier
which range from 81.27 to 81.41 percent accurracy. The confusion matricies for all models are below.

LP, LF Labelled true, labelled false, CT CF classified true classified false
students are considered true, faculty is considered false ex:

   LT   LF
CT TP   FP
CF FN   TN
